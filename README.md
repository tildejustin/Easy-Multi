## To run
- Make sure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed
- Download latest release
- Run `win_install_dependencies.py` (should only ever need to be done once)
- Run `EasyMulti.pyw`

## Todo
- Check compatatility with other mc versions (1.11.2, 1.8, 1.5)
- Make sure timing works universally
- Change some branding so the new version is dicernable from the old version
