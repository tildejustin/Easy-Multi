## To run
- Make sure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed
- Download latest release
- Run the exe

## Todo
- Check compatatility with other mc versions (1.11.2, 1.8, 1.5)
- Make sure timing works universally (so just slow it down lol)
- Change some branding so the new version is dicernable from the old version

## Issues
- If mc lags, there is a good chance the script will hit the quit button on the mc title screen. I can minimize this by waiting a bit after closing a world, but if your computer is laggy it might have to be slowed down more. I plan to add a setting in options.json to accomodate this, so tell me if you have this issue. (or any others, ofc)
